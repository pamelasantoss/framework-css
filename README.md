# Framework CSS
Grid system and many styles using sass

Many styles are ready to use in any project that uses sass.
The ideia to create this was to stop using Bootstrap in all my projects. I wanted to create something mine to reuse and edit in many ways.

## Getting Started

To see the styles, you need to open the `index.html` in your browser. If you need to modify the ready styles, you will find in src folder.

### Installing

```
npm install
```

And then to convert scss to css

```
gulp
```
